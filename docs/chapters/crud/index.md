# CRUD Operations in Jina

Paragraph. CRUD in general.

<!-- Paragraph. Limitations until this point: only index and search. Incremental indexing. ) -->

Until now Jina has only supported indexing (creating) and querying (reading) documents. To update or delete a document, you'd have to edit your dataset, and then re-build the Flow and indexers. Needless to say, this could create problems if you had large datasets.

<!-- What are we doing now? Update, delete. -->
With the release of version X.X.X we're introducing **update** and **delete** operations. These are implemented across our indexers and drivers and will allow you to update and delete documents by their ids. 


```python
# TODO code sample of Flow, or Index, with update, delete
```

## Limitations

Unfortunately there are some limitations to what Jina can do for the moment. These were trade-offs we needed to implement to keep Jina performant, robust, and easy to use. We are working on handling these too.

1. **Partial update**

    For the moment we do not support partial updates. So if you want to update a document, you need to send the entire document. A partial update would allow you to only send a specific field, or part of the document.

1. **Update flows**

   In the context of Flows with segmenters and chunkers, a Document may end up being split into chunks. Currently, the Update request will not work for these. You will need to manually remove the chunks by their `ids`. Then you can remove the parent document as well, by its `id`. Finally, you can index the new document, with its new contents (and thus new, different child chunks).

1. **Sharding, replicas**

   <!-- TODO -->
    This is not handled yet.

1. **Advanced Indexers**

    `Faiss` & `Annoy` indexers don't support updates while querying. Indexers need to be re-loaded. The same goes for the `BinaryPbIndexer`.

   ```python
   # TODO code example
   ```

1. **Expanding size** 

   The update and delete operations use a masking underneath. This is done to maintain high performance overall. However, this means that old data will not be deleted, but will simply be masked as being deleted. Thus the size on disk (and in memory) of the indexer will grow over time if you perform update or delete operations. We recommend you rebuild the indexers regularly.
